# What is this project about?

My IPv4 subnet calculator was originally created to cheat on a school exam, but at last didn't use it.

## How to use it?

Simply compile this project with an (at least) C++14 compiler (GCC or clang) and invoke it on the command line. There is no GUI interface. You can also put some arguments like `./subnet 192.168.0.0 255.255.0.0` or `./subnet 10.0.0.0/8`.
